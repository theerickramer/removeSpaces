For the person who has everything, including a folder full of files with spaces in their filenames! 

- enable shebang! by executing 'chmod u+x removeSpaces.py' in your shell. 

- now type ./removeSpaces.py PATH/TO/DIRECTORY

- BAM!!! WHAT??? Your files with spaces are now renamed with underscores instead. 

*Note*: Your folder name should definitely not have spaces in it either if you want this script to work
